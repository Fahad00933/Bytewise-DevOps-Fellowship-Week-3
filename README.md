# What is Continuous Integration? 

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice that involves frequently and automatically integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared code repository, followed by automated build, test, and deployment processes. The main goal of CI is to catch and fix integration issues and bugs early in the development process, ensuring that the codebase is always in a releasable state and that changes are smoothly integrated with minimal conflicts.

In a typical CI workflow, developers work on their local development environments and regularly push their code changes to a version control system (such as Git). The CI system then automatically builds the code, compiles it, runs automated tests, and deploys the application to a staging or testing environment for further validation. If any issues are detected during these automated processes, the development team is notified, and the issues are resolved promptly.

CI is a key practice in modern software development and is often used in combination with other DevOps practices, such as Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CDep). Continuous Delivery involves ensuring that software changes are always in a releasable state and can be deployed to production at any time, while Continuous Deployment takes it a step further by automatically deploying code changes to production after passing all tests and validations.

Benefits of Continuous Integration include:

1- Early Detection of Integration Issues: By frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers, CI helps in detecting integration issues, such as conflicts, inconsistencies, and dependencies, early in the development process. This allows for prompt resolution of issues, reducing the risk of integration problems during later stages of development or during production deployment.
